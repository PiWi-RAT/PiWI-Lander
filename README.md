# PiWI-Lander
A shadow in the system...  Silent, invisible, and merciless. It slips past defenses without a sound, observes without being seen, and strikes without warning.  It doesn't ask for permission â€” it takes control.  The virus is not a tool... it's a force.  No firewall can stop it. No trace can follow it. Once it's in, it's already too late.
